# The announcement

Today at 4:52 PM on March 27th (California time), Elon has announced that only verified accounts will show up on the "For You page" starting April 15th; this essentially means that accounts that do not pay to be verified or have been verified due to being considered "notable figures" will not show up in Twitter's main feed. Shoving the basic act of showing up behind a paywall and a verification process goes against the anonymous free-speech nature that I loved Twitter for before Elon's reign. I feel that this is only a bad omen for what will be coming in the future, as to quote Elon Musk himself, his attempts at making Twitter "the only platform you can trust".

# What about the bots?

Elon cites the need for this feature as being "advanced AI bot swarms". Bot activity on Twitter has been a problem for users for a long time, with the most notable type of bot being the type that spam direct messages users. Despite Elon claiming that his goal is to fight the bots, Elon has recently been apart of the choice to remove one of the most notable attempts at stopping bots. While many only remember Twitter displaying "sent from (device name)" from funny tweets dunking on celebrities', Twitter actually added the "sent from" text as an attempt to allow users to see what application Tweets are being sent from and in turn if Tweets are coming from an automated software. Despite Elon saying "Literally no one even knows why we did that", this statement appears to come more from Elon's lack of Twitter knowledge than good faith.

# Overall 
Overall this blog post has more been me ranting than anything of actual value, but it helps me put my thoughts down into some text from time to time. If Twitter truly does go under, I will cherish the good times, and be thankful I am free from this hellsite. I wish y'all luck and hope to see you again.
