# Neos Whitepaper 1.10

On August 14th, 2023 the @neos_vr account on Twitter.com released a new [post](https://twitter.com/neos_vr/status/1691112945617444864?s=20). This post is significant because it is a break in the silence that has been formed due to internal disagreements within the team. This post, as many players in the NeosVR community feared, was heavily focused on a cryptocurrency “master plan”. While the post and linked whitepaper gave very little information, “Neos Foundation CEO” Karel Hulec was very vocal on Telegram over the next few days. 

# Stardust

The linked whitepaper under the “Neos Credits” section of neos.com states “Stardust is a Neos-wide, mild gamification element. Through mining random meteor strikes, users can earn a higher Stardust Rank. Initially meteor strikes will be happening only in selected worlds.“ under the “staking process” section. 


The idea of a crypto connected gamification element is something unlike anything we have ever seen in Neos and is hard to even conceptualize how it could securely function. While I could debate on the fact that “mild gamification” makes no sense due to gamification being a binary, I personally feel that this gamification element already being so far removed from the formula of Neos is a cause for concern.

# My Takeaway

I picked up NeosVR in 2020 during the pandemic, I was not mentally in a good place and this game was strongly responsible for reigniting my passion to create things. The Neos community is the first community I have ever felt at home online. While I could go through the whitepaper line by line, I really feel no need to as people smarter than me already have. I feel sadness for what we are leaving behind, but I am excited about what is ahead.
